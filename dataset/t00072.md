## Question

What is the longest city name that's a single word, i.e., excluding names with hyphens and spaces?

## CLI

```
FT.AGGREGATE cities "*" LOAD 1 @city FILTER "!contains(@city, ' ') && !contains(@city, '-')" APPLY "strlen(@city)" AS length GROUPBY 2 @city @length SORTBY 2 @length DESC MAX 1
```
