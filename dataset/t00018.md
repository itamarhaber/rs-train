## Question

A dog breed's aggressiveness is measured by the number of bite incidents that were reported for it. After filtering out breeds that have less than 100 incidents, what are the five least aggressive dog breeds?

## CLI

```
FT.AGGREGATE bites "*" GROUPBY 1 @Breed REDUCE COUNT 0 AS count FILTER "@count >= 100" SORTBY 2 @count ASC MAX 5
```
